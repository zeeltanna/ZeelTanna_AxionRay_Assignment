## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains the complete set of deliverables prepared for the Axion Ray project. The work spans **systematic data tagging, structured data cleaning, and exploratory analysis** to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights. Each task ensures data consistency, interpretability, and supports data-driven decision-making.

## 📝 Assignment Details  

### 1. Data Tagging  
**Objective:** Classify dataset entries into predefined taxonomy categories.  

**Approach:**  
- **Root Cause Tagging:** Extracted keywords from the *Cause* column and mapped them to standard root cause categories.  
- **Symptom Tagging:** Tagged complaint conditions and associated components using known symptom categories.  
- **Fix Tagging:** Interpreted repair actions in the *Correction* column and mapped them to fix categories.  

**Outcome:** Improved categorization revealed frequent issues like *“Not Installed”* and *“Loose connections”*, providing clarity on complaint patterns.

### 2. Data Analysis  
**Objective:** Perform structured analysis of vehicle repair datasets to identify failure patterns, complaint trends, and cost distributions.  

**Process:**  
- **Data Cleaning:** Resolved missing values, standardized formatting, and removed duplicate/incomplete records.  
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Identified recurring failure types such as *Loose connections*, *Not Installed*, and *Faulty Assembly*.  
- **Trend & Cost Analysis:** Studied seasonal impacts, age/mileage effects, and cost breakdowns (labor vs. parts).  
- **Gap Identification:** Highlighted issues such as duplicate transaction IDs and incomplete complaint descriptions.  

**Outcome:** Developed insights to support **maintenance scheduling, predictive repairs, and technician training**, with recommendations for service quality improvement.
